Summary of the Project and Problem Solved:
In these project, we worked with the TI CC3220x. for the fisrt project we develop a code enabling specified functionality for the PWM peripheral. This involved programming LEDs to alternate between 10% and 90% duty cycles. The second project focused on creating code to read characters from the UART, handling only one byte at a time without multi-byte buffering. The characters were then encoded back. Additionally, we developed code to control the LED's on/off states using a state machine, which required implementing GPIO functionality. 

What Did You Do Particularly Well?
I successfully met the criteria for both projects and gained valuable new skills, especially in manipulating the PWM duty cycle in Project 1.

Where Could You Improve?
I encountered significant challenges in creating functional code for the final project, i also had some trouble understanding with timers and interrupts. With more time, I believe I could have resolved these issues.

What Tools and Resources Are You Adding to Your Support Network?
Before this course, I had no prior experience with embedded systems. This experience introduced me to valuable skills and knowledge that I hadnâ€™t explored before, greatly expanding my understanding of embedded system programming.

What Skills From This Project Will Be Particularly Transferable?
Learning and applying the C programming language was a new and significant skill for me, and it will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework.

How Did You Make This Project Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I focused on writing simple, clear code and included detailed comments to explain the functionality and purpose of each section.
